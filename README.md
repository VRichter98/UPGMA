# **UPGMA**


This implementation calculates sequences in fastafile format into the newick format. The distances between the sequences are calculated by [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)

**How to use:**

Before running the program you have to save the sequences of interest as a fastafile. You can find an example of such a fastafile format  [here](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetGene2/fasta.php) or by looking at the [sequence.fasta] file.

If you start running the program, it will ask you for the name of the fastafile. Please, insert this name as follows: _sequence.fasta_

The output is in newick format. Now it is possible to copy the output and paste it in the field for newick format on this website: [Newick Treeviewer](http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/)

Finally press the button : _View tree!_ and and the tree gets visual.
