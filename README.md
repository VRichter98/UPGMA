# **UPGMA**


This implementation calculates from sequences in the fastafile Format the newick format. The Distances of the tree are calculated by [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)

**How to use:**

Before you running the Program you have to save your sequences of interest as a Fastafile. An example for a fastafile Format you can find [here](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetGene2/fasta.php) or look at the sequence.fasta File as an exapmle.

When you start to run the Program will ask you for the name of the Fastafile. Please insert this name there like: _sequence.fasta_

The output is the Newick Format. You can copy this output and paste it in the field for newick format on this website: [Newick Treeviewer](http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/)

Press the _View tree!_ button and you will get the tree!
